## The one-sentence vision

**A human keeps the [board](https://github.com/users/bostonaholic/projects/5)
fed and reviews finished work; everything in between runs itself.**

## What the human does

In the end state, a human is responsible for exactly **two** things:

1. **Fill the Backlog.** Identify new features, bugs, and chores and drop them
   into the **Backlog** column as GitHub issues. This is the creative,
   judgment-heavy work of deciding *what should exist*.
2. **Review what is finished.** Inspect items in the **In Review** column —
   read the PR, accept or request changes, and merge. This is the quality gate
   on *what gets shipped*.

That is the whole job. No shaping tickets by hand, no kicking off pipelines, no
babysitting implementation, no moving cards across the middle of the board.

## What the system does

Everything between "captured in the Backlog" and "ready for human review" is
**fully autonomous**. A continuously running control loop watches the board and
drives work rightward toward the human review gate:

```text
   HUMAN            AUTONOMOUS LOOP                          HUMAN
  ┌───────┐  groom  ┌───────┐  start  ┌─────────────┐  PR   ┌───────────┐  merge  ┌──────┐
  │Backlog│ ──────► │ Ready │ ──────► │ In Progress │ ────► │ In Review │ ──────► │ Done │
  └───────┘         └───────┘         └─────────────┘       └───────────┘         └──────┘
   add work        (Backlog→Ready)   (Ready→In Progress)    open the PR          review +
                    grooming agent    full Team pipeline                          merge
```

**The loop works the board right-to-left — stop starting, start finishing.**
This is the core kanban discipline: throughput comes from *reducing* work in
progress, not from starting more of it. So every cycle the loop looks at the
**rightmost** column first and takes whatever action moves work as far right, as
fast, as possible. It pulls new work in only when nothing already in flight can
be advanced. **Finishing always beats starting.**

In strict priority order (right to left):

1. **In Progress → In Review — finish first.** If a pipeline run is complete,
   open its PR and move the card to In Review: get finished work in front of the
   human and free the In Progress slot. The pipeline runs end to end *without*
   the mid-pipeline human gate (structure already advances autonomously, and the
   design approval will become autonomous too — self-approved after adversarial
   agent review); the single human checkpoint moves to the **end** — the PR review.
2. **Ready → In Progress — start only when nothing's waiting to finish.** When In
   Progress is below its WIP limit *and* no in-flight work can be pushed further
   right, pull the highest-priority Ready item and launch the Team pipeline for
   it in an isolated worktree.
3. **Backlog → Ready — groom last.** When Ready is below its WIP limit, a grooming
   agent picks the most important Backlog item, verifies and rewrites it to a
   ready-to-work standard, and promotes it — refilling the queue only once the
   line downstream is flowing.

The board is the single source of truth. Each cycle the loop reads it, finds the
rightmost action that advances work, executes that one action, and repeats —
**draining the board toward Done rather than flooding it from the Backlog.**

## Why this is the goal

Team already automates the *inside* of a single feature (the QRSPI pipeline).
The remaining human overhead is the *orchestration between* features: grooming,
prioritizing, starting runs, and shepherding cards across the board. Loop-driven
development automates that orchestration too, collapsing the human's role to the
two decisions only a human should own — **what to build** and **what to ship** —
and leaving the mechanical flow to the machine.

## How we get there

The loop is assembled from capabilities the pipeline already has — isolated
worktrees, adversarial review, durable artifacts — plus a control loop over the
board. See [Ethos](ethos.md) for the principles that make the autonomous
middle trustworthy.
