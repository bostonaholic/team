## Quality Loop

```
test-architect → mechanical gate → implementer → 5 reviewers → aggregate gate
                                       ↑                            ↓ fail
                                       └────── (specific fix) ──────┘
                                                                    ↓ pass
                                                              verification clean
```

Each round is a complete re-review with fresh context — reviewers do not
remember previous rounds.
