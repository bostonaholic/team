## Changelog Update

Before creating the ship commit, read [changelog rules](changelog.md) and
update `CHANGELOG.md` per that reference:

1. Scan commits since the last changelog entry using `git log`.
2. Filter to user-facing commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `security:`,
   and any `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Exclude `chore:`, `test:`,
   `refactor:`, `ci:`, `docs:`.
3. Translate each included commit to a plain-language user-facing bullet.
